            <h2>A Brief History of Video Games</h2>
            <p>
                The story of video games begins in the 1950s and 60s with experimental projects like 
                <em>Tennis for Two</em> and <em>Spacewar!</em> These early creations demonstrated computersâ€™ 
                potential for entertainment but lacked commercial focus. The breakthrough came in 1972 with the 
                release of <em>Pong</em> by Atari, marking the birth of video gaming as a mainstream activity. 
                During this period, games were simple and often developed by a single person or small teams, 
                reflecting the technological limitations of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 1980s saw the rise of home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System 
                (NES), which brought gaming into households. Iconic titles like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and 
                <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> introduced complex gameplay and immersive narratives, transforming 
                video games into a storytelling medium. In the 1990s, advances in 3D graphics and platforms like 
                the Sony PlayStation revolutionized gaming. Today, cutting-edge technologies like virtual reality 
                and artificial intelligence redefine what games can achieve.

            <h2>The Stages of Game Development</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Pre-production</h3>
            <p>
                Pre-production is the planning stage where ideas are conceptualized, mechanics are defined, and 
                narratives are outlined. Early games had minimal pre-production, relying on experimentation. Today, 
                this stage involves prototypes, market research, and detailed design documents. Developers assess 
                audience preferences and platform capabilities to ensure their vision aligns with player expectations.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. Production</h3>
            <p>
                The production stage is where the game takes shape. Developers create assets, code gameplay, and 
                integrate visuals and sound. Early games were built within tight constraints by small teams. Modern 
                development uses advanced tools like Unreal Engine to create lifelike graphics, intricate physics, 
                and dynamic AI. Collaborative workflows and iterative testing ensure quality and player satisfaction.
            </p>
            
            <h3>3. Post-production</h3>
            <p>
                Post-production focuses on refining and maintaining the game after launch. Developers release updates, 
                patches, and downloadable content (DLC) to fix bugs and add features. Unlike static early games, modern 
                titles like <em>Fortnite</em> continuously evolve, sustaining player engagement for years.

            <h2>Societal Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The evolution of game development has profoundly influenced society. Video games are a dominant cultural 
                force, offering innovative storytelling and fostering global communities. Game-driven technologies like 
                virtual reality and AI have applications in education and healthcare. However, challenges such as addiction 
                and monetization practices highlight the need for responsible development.
